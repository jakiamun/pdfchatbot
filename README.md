This repository demonstrates how to build Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a method that improves large language models (LLMs) by allowing them to generate answers based on specific documents. The RAG process involves three main steps:

1. Document Splitting: Break documents into smaller, manageable pieces.
2. Embedding and Storage: Turn these pieces into embeddings (numerical representations) and store them in a vector database.
3. Answer Retrieval and Generation: Retrieve the most relevant information and use the LLM to generate accurate answers.

Following is the summary of required library:

LangChain: A framework for building applications with large language models (LLMs), facilitating complex workflows like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
TextLoader: Loads text from various sources into the processing pipeline.
PdfReader: Extracts text from PDF files for further processing.
HuggingFaceHub: Connects to Hugging Face models, including LLMs and embedding models.
Text Splitter: Breaks down large text into smaller, manageable chunks.
Embeddings: Converts text chunks into numerical embeddings for semantic understanding.
Vector Stores (FAISS): Stores and retrieves text embeddings efficiently for similarity searches.
RetrievalQA and ConversationalRetrievalChain: Integrates the retrieval system with the LLM to generate context-aware answers.
